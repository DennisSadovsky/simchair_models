# simchair_models
Simchair MKIII 3D printable models repository

This repo contains all current (supported) models of Simchair MKIII project, sources and STL files. 
A major cleanup is underway, so all the files will now be named using this scheme:
peripheral_part-name_partnumber

I will be adding peripheral files while doing a complete set build for my friends.
Meanwhile, you can still download stuff from my site http://hc625ma.org

If you have questions, please contact me through comments.

Cheers!
